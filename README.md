# EENG-426-Lab-3b
Files for EENG 426 Lab 3b.

These files are the Lab 3b submission for Eddy Zhong and Anthony Etim. We collaborated with Lukas Nel, Ethan Kwok, Joel Binu, Austin Zhu, and Lucas Shepard on this lab.

The zip file contains our ACT files that were used to generate our .rect files. 

There is a test script for our accumulator, called test_accum.scr. The test script can be run with the commands
$ actsim lab3b.act 'accum'
$ source test_accum.scr
